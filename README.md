# Project L3

As of now this project is just trivial OpenGL stuff. I have plans to write a basic game engine in c/c++ and hopefully some of the code from this project will come handy in near future.

Note: The code is written targeting the old OpenGL Fixed Function Pipeline. One of the reasons were that my laptop's graphics card is outdated and only supports old OpenGL FFPipeline. Furthurmore, I used [Freeglut library](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)   which makes writing OpenGL things all over easy.

And the most important thing, some of the code in this project is inspired from David Parker's OpenGL tutorials. You may check out his youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiFAmp2Crv66cQA-9SPje1A)
